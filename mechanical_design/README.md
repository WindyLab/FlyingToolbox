# Mechanical Design 

The mechanical_design folder contains the 3D  models of the Toolbox MAV, the Delta arm, and six end-effector tools  (including a two-finger gripper, three-finger soft electromagnet tool,  scissor tool, liquid inspection tool, and adhesive spraying tool).  These tools enable distinct functions including grasping, cutting,  magnetic attraction, liquid inspection, and adhesive spraying  (see the following figure). All  models are provided in STEP (.stp) format, ensuring seamless compatibility with major CAD software (e.g., SolidWorks,  CATIA) for mechanical design, assembly simulation, and other engineering applications.
